<h1>HTML Midterm</h1>
<span>   </span>
<span>   </span>
<h2>Page 1 Errors</h2>
    <span>  </span>
<p>1. Fixed Boilderplate: I included the <!DOCTYPE html>  and <html lang="en">
    at the very top because it is necessary for all HTML to have. The language tells what language the code is going to be in. </p>
<p>2. Closed the li tag </p>
<p>3. Closed paragraph tag at the bottom</p>
<p>4. Fixed the header tag on the word history</p>
<span>   </span>
<span>   </span>
<h2>Page 2 Errors</h2>
    <span>  </span>
<p>1. I added the b tag, it was missing and not bolding the word New Beehive Inn. .</p>
<p>2. Changed order of closing tags on line 53 in order to accuratley close the tag.</p>
<p>3. Fixed broken Links lines, I added i to the l because it is a link so it needs to be li
<span>   </span>
<span>   </span>
<h2>Page 3 Errors</h2>
    <span>  </span>
<p>1. I included the boilerplate to include !DOCTYPE and also specified the language.</p>
<p>2. I added a link to the CSS stylesheet and linked cars.css</p>
<p>3. I adjusted the headers to put them in order of h1, h2, and so forth.</p>
<p>5. I fixed the li in the links</p>
<span>   </span>
<span>   </span>
<h2>Page 4 Errors</h2>
    <span>  </span>
<p>1. Fixed DOCTYPE html error in line 1 boilerplate.</p>
<p>2. I fixed the images to make sure the layout was correct. All colums contain the same thing. All the dogs are under one column and same for cats and other.</p>
<p>3. I added td aroung images of cat and creature.</p>
<p>4. I included alt desciptions on all the images. </p>
