<h2>Page 1 Errors</h2>
    <span>  </span>
<p>1. Fixed Boilderplate: I included the <!DOCTYPE html>  and <html lang="en">
    at the very top because it is necessary for all HTML to have. The language tells what language the code is going to be in. </p>
<p>2. I inserted the title under the meta for a better layout</p> 
<p>3. Closed the li tag </p>
<p>4. I also organized the code so the Headings were above the navigation and changed the fonts because the date was bigger than the actual heading of the page. This is important because it is easier for the reader to understand the layout based on the font size and weight. </p>
<p>5. Closed paragraph tag at the bottom</p>
<p>6. I added another div above to the paragraphs to signal that this is another section of the code/page. </p>
<p>7. I added the m to the "em" in order to emphasize the word</em></p>
<span>   </span>
<span>   </span>
<h2>Page 2 Errors</h2>
    <span>  </span>
<p>1. I fixed the font size of the navbar and the source page and aligned them to the right for a better layout. I also increased the size of Heading 1 and the weight of it so it sticks out as it is the heading. </p>
<p>2. I added the b within the <>, it was missing and not building the word New Beehive Inn. .</p>
<p>3. Changed order of closing tags on line 53 to properly close tags.</p>
<p>4. Fixed broken Links linesI added i to the l because it is a link so it needs to be li
</p>
<p>5. I changed the font size of all the paragraphs to "small" and went ahead and made the weight to "normal" as it was all bolded. When everything is bolded, it is hard to tell what is emphasized and what is not. I also changed the paragraph headings to a bigger font and made the font-weight to normal. This helps the headings to style the page and divide it into sections. .</p>
<span>   </span>
<span>   </span>
<h2>Page 3 Errors</h2>
    <span>  </span>
<p>1. I included the boilerplate to include !DOCTYPE and also specified the language.</p>
<p>2. I added the th and td to the style in order to better organize the table </p>
<p>3. I adjusted the headers to put them in order of h1, h2, and so forth.</p>
<p>4. I changed the font weight of "Description" to match the source page. </p>
<p>5. I fixed the li in the links</p>
<p>6. I fixed the names in the table to make sure that it has first, last name, and the correct age.</p>
<span>   </span>
<span>   </span>
<h2>Page 4 Errors</h2>
    <span>  </span>
<p>1. Fixed DOCTYPE html error in line 1 boilerplate.</p>
<p>2. I fixed the images to make sure the layout was correct. All colums contain the same thing. All the dogs are under one column and same for cats and other.</p>
<p>3. I added td aroung images of cat and creature.</p>
<p>4. I included alt desciptions on all the images. </p>
