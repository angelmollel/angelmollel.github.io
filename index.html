        <p>Hello, my name is Angel Mollel (she/her), I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder. </p>
        <p>My goal for this semester is to be able to design my own website. I am very passionate about Media Production: whether that is Photography, Videography, or Web Design. 
            I would really love to sharpen my coding skills so I can start designing various websites that will help my life later on. </p> <!-- Change NAME to your name! -->
